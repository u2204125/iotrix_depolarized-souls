# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Please follow these guidelines to keep contributions consistent and reviewable.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`.
2. Keep changes small and focused; one logical change per pull request.
3. Follow existing code style; prefer clear and minimal diffs.
4. Write a clear PR description that explains the why and what of the change.

PR checklist:
- [ ] Runs locally (`pnpm run dev`) and builds (`pnpm run build`) where applicable
- [ ] No sensitive data is included
- [ ] Tests (if any) pass

If you're unsure about a change, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
